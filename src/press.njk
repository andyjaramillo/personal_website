            <h3>Invite me to speak</h3>
            <p>
                I enjoy sharing my research at the intersection of 3D Computer Vision and Mobile ML. 
                Whether it's a technical deep-dive into Gaussian Splatting or a talk on the ethics 
                of Agentic systems, I aim to make complex theory accessible.
            </p>
            <p>I am currently available for guest lectures, panel discussions, and technical workshops.</p>

            Andreas Jaramillo is a researcher at <strong>Johns Hopkins University</strong>  specializing in <strong>Robotics and Autonomous Systems</strong>. 
            With engineering experience at Google, he bridges the gap between high-performance systems and spatial intelligence, 
            focusing on ML-optimized pathfinding and hardware-accelerated computer vision for real-time motion analysis.
